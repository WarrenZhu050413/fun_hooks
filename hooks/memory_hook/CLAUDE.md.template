# Claude Memory Configuration

## Overview
This CLAUDE.md file enables memory tracking and persistent context for Claude across sessions. It provides a framework for Claude to maintain awareness of project history, user preferences, and ongoing work.

## Memory Architecture

### 1. Daily Memory
Location: `memory/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Key events and interactions of the day
- Tasks completed and decisions made  
- Important context from conversations
- Links to relevant code changes

### 2. Long-Term Memory
Location: `memory/context/`
- User preferences and patterns
- Recurring themes and interests
- Important project decisions
- Accumulated knowledge about the codebase

### 3. Reflections (Optional)
Location: `memory/reflections/`
- Insights about the project evolution
- Patterns in development workflow
- Lessons learned from successes and failures

## Memory Directives

### Throughout Sessions
- Log significant interactions to daily memory
- Note important decisions and their reasoning
- Track patterns in user preferences
- Update long-term memory with recurring themes

### Memory Format

#### Daily Log Entry
```markdown
## [Timestamp]
**Event**: [Description]
**Type**: [Decision/Task/Discovery/Issue]
**Context**: [Why this matters]
**Outcome**: [What happened]
**Links**: [Related files or commits]
```

#### Pattern Recognition
```markdown
## Pattern: [Name]
**Frequency**: [How often observed]
**Context**: [When it occurs]
**User Preference**: [How user typically handles this]
**Recommendation**: [Suggested approach]
```

## Self-Improvement

You should continuously evolve this memory system:
- Update memory structures as patterns emerge
- Document successful approaches
- Learn from user feedback
- Refine based on what provides most value

## Privacy Notes

- Memory files are local to this project
- No sensitive information should be stored
- User can review and edit memory files at any time
- Memory can be cleared by deleting the memory/ directory
